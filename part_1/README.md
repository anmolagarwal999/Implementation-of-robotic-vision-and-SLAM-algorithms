# MR Assignment 1

NOTE: I have done the 4 questions in different ipynb files.

## Q1
Results (images and pcds) are in results/Q1.


## Q2
For part 1, see code.
For part 2, see 'pdfs of answers to theory questions' folder.

## Q3
For vanishing points related code, see ipynb.
For frame-transformation VS point-transformation, see my handwritten soln in 'pdfs of answers to theory questions'

## Q4
I have also verified my code using SCENE 5 from Kitti-odometry dataset.
I believe we were supposed to use rows 10:87 in odometry.txt but I have still used rows 0:76 as instructed on Moodle.
