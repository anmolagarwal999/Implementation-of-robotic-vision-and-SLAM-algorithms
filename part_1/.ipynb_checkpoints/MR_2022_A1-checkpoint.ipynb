    "Point clouds are a collection of points that represent a 3D shape or feature. Each point has its own set of X, Y and Z coordinates and in some cases additional attributes. A popular way to obtain this is by photogrammetry, though here we will use LiDAR data.\n",

    "LiDAR is a remote sensing process which collects measurements used to create 3D models and maps of objects and environments. Using ultraviolet, visible, or near-infrared light, LiDAR gauges spatial relationships and shapes by measuring the time it takes for signals to bounce off objects and return to the scanner.\n",
