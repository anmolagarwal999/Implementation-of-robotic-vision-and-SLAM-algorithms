    "1. Please find mesh files in **data/Q1** folder. Using these mesh files and your own creativity/visualisation, create a \"Table\" **pointcloud** scene. The table scene should be realistic, scaled appropiately. Use all the meshes given in the folder and treat them as objects kept on the table. \n",
    "\n",
    "    You are expected to perform different functions on the individual mesh files: first convert the mesh files to pointclouds and on each pointcloud perform operations such as scaling, rotation, translation. Next, visualize them together. The visualization should represent a pointcloud of a realistic table scene. Save the scene as **.pcd** file. \n",

    "2. Use the final table scene pointcloud obtained from part 1. \n",
    "    - Use Open3D to generate partial pointclouds from different camera views (at least 4 views). This means, that you need to crop or capture the points in the pointcloud that are visible only from a given viewpoint. \n",
    "    - Using these partial pointclouds, you are now expected to generate the full scene pointcloud back by registering the pointclouds to a global frame. Save the partial and reconstructed pointclouds in different files. \n",
    "    - **[ BONUS ]** Finally, compute the error using \"Chamfer's Distance (CD)\" between the ground truth scene pointcloud and the reconstructed pointcloud. Perform an analysis: \n",
    "      1. Why is the CD not 0?\n",
    "      2. How does the CD change as the number of viewpoints increase / decrease? \n",
